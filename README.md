### Synthetic assets  

***What is synthetic asset***  

Synthetic assets are composed of one or more financial derivatives, and their asset value is based on the value of underlying assets (financial derivatives), including: forward commitments: futures, forward contracts and swaps. Contingent claims: options, credit derivatives (for example: credit default swaps, credit default swaps-CDS) and asset-backed bonds. Synthetic assets can be used to simulate other financial instruments. In other words, the risk or return of any financial instrument can be simulated with a combination of other financial instruments.

***How synthetic assets work***  

Synthetic assets are something that track actual asset prices. They enable holders to trade various asset classes on Ethereum without holding their own actual assets or entrusting any custodian. Synthetic assets are supported by Mixtrust protocol Token (MXT). When MXT is used as collateral, it is mortgaged at a rate of 600%. In the cross-chain transaction system, MXT acts as a ticket exchange and supports the exchange of digital tokens from different networks.

### Cross-chain asset transactions  

MixTrust will provide an intermediary method without permission, without the participation of intermediate agencies, directly realize the transfer of multiple protocol assets in a decentralized, detrusted, and fast manner. At present, algorithm support for cryptocurrency over-the-counter (OTC) is still vacant, and investors have no way to conduct a large amount of cryptocurrency trading without disturbing market prices; the main factor causing its impact is because of the blockchain all transactions on the market are public, including off-exchange transactions. Automated applications like Whale Alert can draw users' attention to large transactions, which can lead to price fluctuations. When someone transfers a large amount of cryptocurrency from a wallet to an exchange, this behavior will be considered to be intended to sell the asset; on the contrary, the act of withdrawing a large amount of cryptocurrency from the exchange to the wallet, or the transfer between wallets, this behavior shows that investors believe that cryptocurrency is valuable and worth holding or buying. Over-the-counter trading applies almost exclusively to wealthy investors who do not want to cause a sensation in the market. Because of the openness of cryptocurrency (such as bitcoin), centralized over-the-counter transactions have to be introduced, and there is a lack of interconnection between chains in algorithms.

MXT utilizes its core platform, the Mixtrust platform, which can realize the cross-chain decentralization and detrust exchange of cryptocurrency assets. Mixtrust uses a "fund pool node" network to achieve this goal. The fund pool node provides the necessary computing power to identify and process cross-chain cryptocurrency orders. It will fragment the order information, making it impossible for the fund pool node to distinguish the specific amount of the encrypted currency being traded and the recipient of the payment. The Mixtrust platform is built on Ethereum, and cross-chain transactions are performed on the Ethereum blockchain using the ERC-20 token equivalent of the asset being traded. 
To put it simply, during the transaction process, the real Bitcoin or Zcash was not transferred to the Ethereum blockchain, and the ERC-20 tokens of these cryptocurrencies that need to be traded are held according to the Mixtrust decentralized platform or the amount released is used for casting and destruction.

Mixtrust is a DApp built on the Ethereum blockchain, Mixtrust has developed two tools, namely MxtJS and ConnectJS, which allows encoders to integrate Mixtrust into other blockchains. We have also created a Simple tool to help Ethereum DApp developer Mixtrust integrate into their applications.
Mixtrust Exchange-synthetic asset trading Synthetic assets can provide transactions for such assets without holding certain actual assets. Synthetic assets have a series of advantages, including reducing the friction when switching between different assets (for example, from Apple stock to synthetic gold), expanding the accessibility of certain assets, and anti-censorship.

### Cross-chain mortgage lending  

***Casting, destruction and mortgage rate***  

MXT holders are encouraged to hold MXT and found synthetic assets in a variety of ways.
First, the mortgage incentive mechanism. A transaction reward is generated whenever someone swaps one composite asset into another. Each transaction generates a 0.3% transaction fee, which is deposited in the fee pool. The MXT mortgagor can apply for the MXT in the expense pool as a transaction reward on a pro rata basis every week. 
Second, hold the reward mechanism. Holding MXT can enjoy daily interest, which is calculated daily at a daily interest rate of 0.1% and liquidated once a week.


***Mortgagor, debtor and counterparty***  

The MXT mortgagor creates "debt" when it creates synthetic assets. Depending on the exchange rate and supply of synthetic assets in the network, this debt can increase or decrease independently of its original found value. For example, if 100% of the synthetic assets in the system are synthetic Ethereum (mxtETH), when the price of ETH is halved, 
the debt in the system will be halved, and the debt of each mortgagor will also be halved. This means that in another case, when only half of the synthetic assets in the system are mxtETH, and the price of ETH doubles, the total debt of the system (and the debt of each risk taker) will increase by a quarter. In this way, all MXT mortgagors become counterparties to all synthetic asset exchanges; the mortgagor bears the risk of all debts in the system. They can choose to hedge outside the system to avoid this risk. By taking this risk, all mortgagors can enable transactions to be generated on Mixtrust, thereby obtaining the share of transaction rewards generated by the system.
